\section{Feasibility Study (Technical,Economical,Operational)}
Feasibility study is made to see if the project on completion will serve the purpose of the organization for the amount of work, effort and the time that spend on it. Feasibility study lets the developer foresee the future of the project and the usefulness. A feasibility study of a system proposal is according to its workability, which is the impact on the organization, ability to meet their user needs and effective use of resources. Carrying out a feasibility study involves information assessment, information collection and report writing. The information assessment phase identifies the information that is required to answer the three questions set out above. Once the information has been identified, you should question information sources to discover the answers to these questions Thus when a new application is proposed it normally goes through a feasibility study before it is approved for development.

A feasibility study is designed to provide an overview of the primary issues related to a business idea.  The purpose is to identify any “make or break” issues that would prevent your business from being successful in the marketplace. In other words, a feasibility study determines whether the business idea makes sense. A thorough feasibility analysis provides a lot of information necessary for the business plan.  For example, a good market analysis is necessary in order to determine the project’s feasibility.  This information provides the basis for the market section of the business plan.

The document provide the feasibility of the project that is being designed and lists various areas that were considered very carefully during the feasibility study of this project such as Technical, Economic and Operational feasibilities. Feasibility is defined as the practical extent to which a project can be performed successfully. To evaluate feasibility, a feasibility study is performed, which determines whether the solution considered to accomplish the requirements is practical and workable in the software. Information such as resource availability, cost estimation for software development, benefits of the software to the organization after it is developed and cost to be incurred on its maintenance are considered during the feasibility study. The objective of the feasibility study is to establish the reasons for developing the software that is acceptable to users, adaptable to change and conformable to established standards.

Objectives of feasibility study are listed below.
\begin{itemize}
	\item To analyze whether the software will meet organizational requirements
	\item To determine whether the software can be implemented using the current technology and within the specified budget and schedule
	\item To determine whether the software can be integrated with other existing software.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Types of Feasibility}
Various types of feasibility that are commonly considered include technical feasibility, operational feasibility, and economic feasibility.

\subsubsection{Technical Feasibility}
Technical feasibility is one of the first studies that must be conducted after the project has been identified. In large engineering projects consulting agencies that have large staffs of engineers and technicians conduct technical studies dealing with the projects. In individual agricultural projects financed by local agricultural credit corporations, the technical staff composed of specialized agricultural engineers, irrigation and construction engineers, and other technicians are responsible for conducting such feasibility studies. The technical feasibility assessment is focused on gaining an understanding of the present technical resources of the organization and their applicability to the expected needs of the proposed system. It is an evaluation of the hardware and software and how it meets the need of the proposed system. This assessment is based on an outline design of system requirements, to determine whether the company has the technical expertise to handle completion of the project. When writing a feasibility report, the following should be taken to consideration:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A brief description of the business to assess more possible factors which could affect the study
	\item The part of the business being examined
	\item The human and economic factor
	\item The possible solutions to the problem
\end{itemize}

The system must be evaluated from the technical point of view first. The assessment of this feasibility must be based on an outline design of the system requirement in the terms of input, output, programs and procedures. Having identified an outline system, the investigation must go on to suggest the type of equipment, required method developing the system, of running the system once it has been designed. Technical feasibility assesses the current resources (such as hardware and software) and technology, which are required to accomplish user requirements in the software within the allocated time and budget. For this, the software development team ascertains whether the current resources and technology can be upgraded or added in the software to accomplish specified user requirements. Technical feasibility also performs the following tasks.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Analyzes the technical skills and capabilities of the software development team members
	\item Determines whether the relevant technology is stable and established
	\item Ascertains that the technology chosen for software development has a large number of users so that they can be consulted when problems arise or improvements are required.
\end{itemize}

Technical issues raised during the investigation are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Does the existing technology sufficient for the suggested one?
	\item Can the system expand if developed?
\end{itemize}

The project should be developed such that the necessary functions and performance are achieved within the constraints. The project is developed within latest technology. Through the technology may become obsolete after some period of time, due to the fact that never version of same software supports older versions, the system may still be used. So there are minimal constraints involved with this project. The system has been developed using Java the project is technically feasible for development.

\subsubsection{Economic Feasibility}
The purpose of the economic feasibility assessment is to determine the positive economic benefits to the organization that the proposed system will provide. It includes quantification and identification of all the benefits expected. This assessment typically involves a cost/ benefits analysis.

Economic feasibility is the cost and logistical outlook for a business project or endeavor. Prior to embarking on a new venture, most businesses conduct an economic feasibility study, which is a study that analyzes data to determine whether the cost of the prospective new venture will ultimately be profitable to the company. Economic feasibility is sometimes determined within an organization, while other times companies hire an external company that specializes in conducting economic feasibility studies for them.

The purpose of business in a capitalist society is to turn a profit, or to earn positive income. While some ideas seem excellent when they are first presented, they are not always economically feasible. That is, that they are not always profitable or even possible within a company's budget. Since companies often determine their budget's several months in advance, it is necessary to know how much of the budget needs to be set aside for future projects. Economic feasibility helps companies determine what that dollar amount is before a project is ultimately approved. This allows companies to carefully manage their money to insure the most profitable projects are undertaken. Economic feasibility also helps companies determine whether or not revisions to a project that at first seems unfeasible will make it feasible.

The developing system must be justified by cost and benefit. Criteria to ensure that effort is concentrated on project, which will give best, return at the earliest. One of the factors, which affect the development of a new system, is the cost it would require. Economic feasibility determines whether the required software is capable of generating financial gains for an organization. It involves the cost incurred on the software development team, estimated cost of hardware and software, cost of performing feasibility study, and so on. For this, it is essential to consider expenses made on purchases (such as hardware purchase) and activities required to carry out software development. In addition, it is necessary to consider the benefits that can be achieved by developing the software. Software is said to be economically feasible if it focuses on the issues listed below.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cost incurred on software development to produce long-term gains for an organization.
	\item Cost required to conduct full software investigation (such as requirements elicitation and requirements analysis).
	\item Cost of hardware, software, development team, and training.
\end{itemize}

The following are some of the important financial questions asked during preliminary investigation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The costs conduct a full system investigation.
	\item The cost of the hardware and software.
	\item The benefits in the form of reduced costs or fewer costly errors.
\end{itemize}

Since the system is developed as part of project work, there is no manual cost to spend for the proposed system. Also all the resources are already available, it give an indication of the system is economically possible for development.

\subsubsection{Operational Feasibility}
Behavioral feasibility assesses the extent to which the required software performs a series of steps to solve business problems and user requirements. It is a measure of how well the solution of problems or a specific alternative solution will work in the organization. It is also measure of how people feel about the system. If the system is not easy to operate, than operational process would be difficult. The operator of the system should be given proper training. The system should be made such that the user can interface the system without any problem.

Operational feasibility is a measure of how well a proposed system solves the problems, and takes advantage of the opportunities identified during scope definition and how it satisfies the requirements identified in the requirements analysis phase of system development. The operational feasibility assessment focuses on the degree to which the proposed development projects fits in with the existing business environment and objectives with regard to development schedule, delivery date, corporate culture, and existing business processes.

To ensure success, desired operational outcomes must be imparted during design and development. These include such design-dependent parameters such as reliability, maintainability, supportability, usability, producibility, disposability, sustainability, affordability and others. These parameters are required to be considered at the early stages of design if desired operational behaviors are to be realized. A system design and development requires appropriate and timely application of engineering and management efforts to meet the previously mentioned parameters. A system may serve its intended purpose most effectively when its technical and operating characteristics are engineered into the design. Therefore, operational feasibility is a critical aspect of systems engineering that needs to be an integral part of the early design phasesThis feasibility is dependent on human resources (software development team) and involves visualizing whether the software will operate after it is developed and be operative once it is installed. Operational feasibility also performs the following tasks.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Determines whether the problems anticipated in user requirements are of high priority.
	\item Determines whether the solution suggested by the software development team is acceptable.
	\item Analyzes whether users will adapt to a new software.
	\item Determines whether the organization is satisfied by the alternative solutions proposed by the software development team.
\end{itemize}

This includes the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is there sufficient support for the users?
	\item Will the proposed system cause harm?
	\item The project would be beneficial because it satisfies the objectives when developed and installed. All behavioral aspects are considered carefully and conclude that the project is behaviorally feasible.
\end{itemize}

\section{Software Requirement Analysis}
Software requirement analysis is a process of gathering and interpreting facts, diagnosing problems and the information to recommend improvements on the system. It is a problem solving activity that requires intensive communication between the system users and system developers. System analysis or study is an important phase of any system development process. The system is studied to the minutest detail and analyzed. The system analyst plays the role of the interrogator and dwells deep into the working of the present system. The system is viewed as a whole and the input to the system are identified. The outputs from the organizations are traced to the various processes. System analysis is concerned with becoming aware of the problem, identifying the relevant and decisional variables, analyzing and synthesizing the various factors and determining an optimal or at least a satisfactory solution or program of action.\\

\noindent A detailed study of the process must be made by various techniques like interviews, questionnaires etc. The data collected by these sources must be scrutinized to arrive to a conclusion. The conclusion is an understanding of how the system functions. This system is called the existing system. Now the existing system is subjected to close study and problem areas are identified. The designer now functions as a problem solver and tries to sort out the difficulties that the enterprise faces. The solutions are given as proposals. The proposal is then weighed with the existing system analytically and the best one is selected. The proposal is presented to the user for an endorsement by the user. The proposal is reviewed on user request and suitable changes are made. This is loop that ends as soon as the user is satisfied with proposal.\\

\noindent Preliminary study is the process of gathering and interpreting facts, using the information for further studies on the system. Preliminary study is problem solving activity that requires intensive communication between the system users and system developers. It does various feasibility studies. In these studies a rough figure of the system activities can be obtained, from which the decision about the strategies to be followed for effective system study and analysis can be taken.

\section{Technologies Used}
Android provides a rich application framework that allows you to build innovative
apps and games for mobile devices in a Java language environment. The documents
listed in the left navigation provide details about how to build apps using Android's
various APIs.The various fundamental concepts about the Android app framework: 

\subsection{Android}
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.38]{images/a1.jpg}
\caption{Android Anatomy}
\label{fig:Anatomy}
\end{figure}

Apps provide multiple entry points.Android apps are built as a combination of distinct components that can be invoked individually. For instance, an individual activity provides a single screen for a userinterface, and a service independently performs work in the background. From one component you can start another component using an intent. You can even start a component in a different app, such as an activity in a maps app to show an
address. This model provides multiple entry points for a single app and allows any
app to behave as a user's "default" for an action that other apps may invoke.

Apps adapt to different devices, Android provides an adaptive app framework that allows you to provide unique resources for different device configurations. For example, you can create different XML layout les for different screen sizes and the system determines which layout
to apply based on the current device's screen size. You can query the availability of device features at runtime if any app features require specific hardware such as
a camera. If necessary, you can also declare features your app requires so app markets such as Google Play Store do not allow installation on devices that do not
support that feature Android comes with an Android market which is an online
software store. It was developed by Google.

 It allows Android users to select, and
download applications developed by third party developers and use them. There
are around 2.0 lack+ games, application and widgets available on the market for
users. Android applications are written in java programming language. Android is
available as open source for developers to develop applications which can be
further used for selling in android market. There are around 200000 applications
developed for android with over 3 billion+ downloads. Android relies on Linux version 2.6 for core system services such as security, memory management, process management, network stack, and driver model. For software development, Android provides Android SDK (Software development kit).

\subsection{Activity Lifecycle}
Activities in the system are managed as an activity stack. When a new activity
is started, it is placed on the top of the stack and becomes the running activitythe previous activity always remains below it in the stack, and will not come to
the foreground again until the new activity exits. An activity has essentially four
states:
If an activity in the foreground of the screen (at the top of the stack), it is
active or running.

If an activity has lost focus but is still visible (that is, a new non-full-sized or
transparent activity has focus on top of your activity), it is paused. A paused
activity is completely alive (it maintains all state and member information and
remains attached to the window manager), but can be killed by the system in
extreme low memory situations.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/a2.png}
\caption{Activity Life Cycle}
\label{fig: Activity }
\end{figure}

If an activity is completely obscured by another activity, it is stopped. It still
retains all state and member information, however, it is no longer visible to
the user so its window is hidden and it will often be killed by the system when
memory is needed elsewhere.

If an activity is paused or stopped, the system can drop the activity from memory by either asking it to finish, or simply killing its process. When it is displayed again to the user, it must be completely restarted and restored to its previous state.

\subsection{Any other supporting Language}
Java is a platform-independent programming language used to create secure
and robust application that may run on a single computer or may be distributed
among servers and clients over a network.

Java features such as platform-independency and portability ensure that while
de-veloping Java EE enterprise applications, you do not face the problems
related to hardware , network , and the operating system.

Java was started as a project called "Oak" by James Gosling in June 1991.
Gosling's goals were to implement a virtual machine and a language that had a
familiar C like notation but with greater uniformity and simplicity than C/C++.
The First publication of Java 1.0 was released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It
made the promise of "Write Once, Run Anywhere", with free runtimes on
popular platforms. In 2006-2007 Sun released java as open source and
andplateform independent soft-ware. Over time new enhanced versions of Java
have been released. The current version of Java is Java 1.7 which is also
known as Java 7.he Java virtual machine (JVM) is a software implementation of
a computer that executes programs like a real machine. The Java virtual
machine is written specifically for a specific operating system, e.g. for Linux a
special implementation is required as well as for Windows.

Java programs are compiled by the Java compiler into bytecode. The Java
virtual machine interprets this bytecode and executes the Java program.
The Java runtime environment (JRE) consists of the JVM and the Java class li-
braries and contains the necessary functionality to start Java programs.
The JDK contains in addition the development tools necessary to create Java
pro-grams. The JDK consists therefore of a Java compiler, the Java virtual
machine, and the Java class libraries.

The characteristics and features of java are as follows :

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Simple}
Simple Java is a simple language because of its various features, Java
Doesn?t Support Pointers , Operator Overloading etc. It doesnt require
unreferenced object because java support automatic garbage collection.
Java provides bug free system due to the strong memory management.

\item \textbf{OOPS}
Object-Oriented Programming Language (OOPs) is the
methodology which provide software development and maintenance by
using
object
state,
behavior
Programming Lan-guage
must
,
and
have
properties.
the
Object Oriented following characteristics.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Encapsulation
\item Polymor-phism
 \item Inheritance
\item Abstraction

\end{itemize}
As the languages like Objective C, C++ fullls the above four characteristics yet
they are not fully object oriented lan-guages because they are structured
as well as object oriented languages.In java everything is an Object. Java
can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.
\item \textbf{Secure}
Secure Java is Secure Language because of its many features it enables to
develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are
based on public-key encryption. Java does not support pointer explicitly for
the memory. All Program Run under the sandbox.

\item \textbf{Robust}
Robust Java was created as a strongly typed language. Data type issues
and problems are resolved at compile-time, and implicit casts of a variable
from one type to another are not allowed.
\item \textbf{Platform-independent}
Platform-independent Java Language is platform-independent due to its
hardware and software environment. Java code can be run on multiple
plat-forms e.g. windows, Linux, sun Solaris, Mac/Os etc. Java code is
compiled by the compiler and converted into byte code. This byte code is a
platform independent code because it can be run on multiple platforms i.e.
Write Once and Run Anywhere(WORA).
\item \textbf{Architectural Neural}
Architecture neutral It is not easy to write an application that can be used
on Windows , UNIX and a Macintosh. And its getting more complicated
with the move of windows to non Intel CPU architectures.
Java takes a diffierent approach. Because the Java compiler creates byte
code instructions that are subsequently interpreted by the java interpreter,
archi-tecture neutrality is achieved in the implementation of the java
interpreter for each new architecture.
\item \textbf{Portable}
Portable Java code is portable. It was an important design goal of Java that it
be portable so that as new architectures(due to hardware, operating system,
or both) are developed, the java environment could be ported to them.
In java, all primitive types(integers, longs, oats, doubles, and so on) are
20of de ned sizes, regardless of the machine or operating system on which
the program is run. This is in direct contrast to languages like C and C++
that leave the sized of primitive types up to the compiler and developer.
Additionally, Java is portable because the compiler itself is written in Java.
\item \textbf{Dynamic}
Dynamic Because it is interpreted , Java is an extremely dynamic language, At
runtime, the java environment can extends itself by linking in classes that may
be located on remote servers on a network(for example, the internet)
At runtime, the java interpreter performs name resolution while linking in the
necessary classes. The Java interpreter is also responsible for determining
the placement of object in memory. These two features of the Java interpreter
solve the problem of changing the de nition of a class used by other classes.
\item \textbf{Interpreted}
We all know that Java is an interpreted language as well. With
an interpreted language such as Java, programs run directly from the
source code.
The interpreter program reads the source code and translates it on the y
into computations. Thus, Java as an interpreted language depends on an
interpreter program.
The versatility of being platform independent makes Java to outshine from
other languages. The source code to be written and distributed is platform
independent.
Another advantage of Java as an interpreted language is its error
debugging quality. Due to this any error occurring in the program gets
traced. This is how it is di erent to work with Java.
\item \textbf{High performance}
High performance For all but the simplest or most infrequently used appli-cations,
performance is always a consideration for most applications, including
21graphics-intensive ones such as are commonly found on the world wide web,
the performance of java is more than adequate.
\item \textbf{Multithreading}
Writing a computer program that only does a single thing at a
time is an artificial constraint that lived with in most programming
languages. With java, we no longer have to live with this limitation. Support
for multiple, synchronized threads is built directly into the Java language
and runtime environment. Synchronized threads are extremely useful in
creating distributed, network-aware applications. Such as application may
be commu-nicating with a remote server in one thread while interacting
with a user in a different thread.
\item \textbf{Distributed}
Java facilitates the building of distributed application by a collection
of classes for use in networked applications. By using javas URL (Uniform
Resource Locator) class, an application can easily access a remote server.
Classes also are provided for establishing socket-level connections.


\end{itemize}



\subsection{Introduction to \LaTeX}
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{images/latex.png}
\caption{\LaTeX{} Logo}
\end{figure}
\hspace{-1.8em} \LaTeX{}, I had never heard about this term before doing this project,
but when I came to know about it's features, it is just excellent. 
\LaTeX (pronounced /ˈleɪtɛk/, /ˈleɪtɛx/, /ˈlɑːtɛx/, or /ˈlɑːtɛk/) is a 
document markup language and document preparation system for the \TeX{} 
typesetting  program. Within the typesetting system, its name is styled 
as \LaTeX.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/donald.jpg}
\caption{Donald Knuth, Inventor Of \TeX{} typesetting system}
\end{figure}

\hspace{-1.8em} Within the typesetting system, its name is styled as \LaTeX. The term 
\LaTeX{} refers only to the language in which documents are written, 
not to the editor used to write those documents. In order to create a 
document in \LaTeX, a .tex file must be created using some form of text 
editor. While most text editors can be used to create a \LaTeX{} document, 
a number of editors have been created specifically for working with \LaTeX.\\

\noindent\LaTeX{} is most widely used by mathematicians, scientists, 
engineers, philosophers, linguists, economists and other scholars in 
academia. As a primary or intermediate format, e.g., translating DocBook 
and other XML-based formats to PDF, \LaTeX{} is used because of the 
high quality of typesetting achievable by \TeX. The typesetting system 
offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities 
for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, 
including numbering and cross-referencing, tables and figures, 
page layout and bibliographies.\\

\noindent\LaTeX{} is intended to provide a high-level language that
accesses the power of \TeX. \LaTeX{} essentially comprises a
collection of \TeX{} macros and a program to process \LaTeX documents. 
Because the \TeX{} formatting commands are very low-level, it is usually 
much simpler for end-users to use \LaTeX{}.


\subsubsection{Typesetting}
\LaTeX{} is based on the idea that authors should be able to focus on 
the content of what they are writing without being distracted by its 
visual presentation. in preparing a \LaTeX{} document, the author 
specifies the logical structure using familiar concepts such as 
chapter, section, table, figure, etc., and lets the \LaTeX{} system 
worry about the presentation of these structures. it therefore 
encourages the separation of layout from content while still allowing 
manual typesetting adjustments where needed. 

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\title{\LaTeX}
\begin{document}
  \maketitle 
  \LaTeX{} is a document preparation system 
  for the \TeX{} typesetting program.
   \par 
   $E=mc^2$
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Installing \LaTeX{} on System}
Installation of \LaTeX{} on personal system is quite easy. As i have used \LaTeX{} on Ubuntu 13.04 so i am discussing the installation steps for Ubuntu 13.04 here:
\begin{itemize}
\item Go to terminal and type\\\\
\textit{sudo apt-get install texlive-full}
\item Your Latex will be installed on your system and you can check for manual page by typing.\\\\
\textit{man latex}\\

in terminal which gives manual for latex command.
\item To do very next step now one should stick this to mind that the document which one is going to produce is written in any type of editor whether it may be your most common usable editor Gedit or you can use vim by installing first vim into your system using command.\\\\
\textit{sudo apt-get install vim}
\item After you have written your document it is to be embedded with some set of commands that Latex uses so as to give a structure to your document. Note that whenever you wish your document to be looked into some other style just change these set of commands.
\item When you have done all these things save your piece of code with .tex format say test.tex. Go to terminal and type\\\\
\textit{latex path of the file test.tex Or pdflatex path of the file test.tex\\ eg: pdflatex test.tex}\\
for producing pdf file simultaneously.\\
After compiling it type command\\\\
\textit{evince filename.pdf\\ eg: evince test.pdf}\\
To see output pdf file. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Making Graphics in \LaTeX{}}
\LaTeX{} s also know popularly for making complex graphics. One such example is shown below here:\\
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{calendar,shadings}
\renewcommand*{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}
\colorlet{winter}{blue}
\colorlet{spring}{green!60!black}
\colorlet{summer}{orange}
\colorlet{fall}{red}
\newcount\mycount
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[transform shape,
every day/.style={anchor=mid,font=\tiny}]
\node[circle,shading=radial,outer color=blue!30,inner color=white,
minimum width=15cm] {\textcolor{blue!80!black}{\Huge\the\year}};
\foreach \month/\monthcolor in
{1/winter,2/winter,3/spring,4/spring,5/spring,6/summer,
7/summer,8/summer,9/fall,10/fall,11/fall,12/winter} {
\mycount=\month
\advance\mycount by -1
\multiply\mycount by 30
\advance\mycount by -90
\shadedraw[shading=radial,outer color=\monthcolor!30,middle color=white,
inner color=white,draw=none] (\the\mycount:5.4cm) circle(1.4cm);
\calendar at (\the\mycount:5.4cm) [
dates=\the\year-\month-01 to \the\year-\month-last]
if (day of month=1) {\large\color{\monthcolor!50!black}\tikzmonthcode}
if (Sunday) [red]
if (all) {
\mycount=1
\advance\mycount by -\pgfcalendarcurrentday
\multiply\mycount by 11
\advance\mycount by 90
\pgftransformshift{\pgfpointpolar{\mycount}{1.2cm}}};}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}\\
%\begin{figure}[ht]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/3d.png}
%\caption{Graphics in \LaTeX{}}
%\end{figure}
\LaTeX{} with just invoking few additional packages.

\subsubsection{Pdfscreen \LaTeX{}}
There are some packages that can help to have unified document using \LaTeX{}. Example of such a package is pdfscreen that let the user view it’s document in two forms-print and screen. Print for hard copy and screen for viewing your document on screen. Download this package from www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pdfscreen/.\\
Then install it using above mention method.\\

\noindent To test it the test code is given below:-\\
Just changing print to screen gives an entirely different view. But for working of pdfscreen another package required are comment and fancybox.\\

\noindent The fancybox package provides several different styles of boxes for framing and rotating content in your document. Fancybox provides commands that produce square-cornered boxes with single or double lines, boxes with shadows, and round-cornered boxes with normal or bold lines. You can box mathematics, floats, center, flushleft, and flushright, lists, and pages.\\
 	
\noindent Whereas comments package selectively include/excludes portions of text. The comment package allows you to declare areas of a document to be included or excluded. One need to make these declarations in the preamble of your file. The package uses a method for exclusion that is pretty robust, and can cope with ill-formed bunches of text.\\

\noindent So these extra packages needed to be installed on system for the proper working of pdfscreen package.
\subsubsection{Web based graphic generation using \LaTeX{}}
\LaTeX{} is also useful when there is need of generating the graphics from browser. For
example to draw a circle by just entering its radius in html input box. So this kind
A
of project can be conveniently handled using \LaTeX{}. Basic idea behind this generation
process is that when user clicks on submit button after entering radius a script will run
that enter the radius in already made .tex file and recompiles it on server and makes its
pdf and postscript file. After that user can view those files by clicking on link provided
to view the files. See some screen shots of such a graphic generation project made by
Dr. H.S. Rai:\\
So here in the above input page which is also the index page user can enter input
for length of rectangle, breadth of rectangle and for radius of circle after that user can submit the values. After the values get submitted a script get runs by php code at server
side. This script first enters the dimensions of rectangle and circle that were selected by
user in to an already existing .tex file and replace with the older dimensions there. After
that script recompiles the the tex file and make it available for user.\\
	
\noindent In above figure it gets clear that .tex file has been compiled and pdf and postscript files
are available to user and user can download the graphics so produced. Hence graphics
can be generated in \LaTeX{} through web interface.

\subsection{Doxygen}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering \includegraphics[scale=1]{images/doxygen.jpg}
\end{figure}
Doxygen is a documentation generator, a tool for writing software reference documentation. The documentation is written within code, and is thus relatively easy to keep up to date. Doxygen can cross reference documentation and code, so that the reader of a document can easily refer to the actual code.
Doxygen supports multiple programming languages, especially C++, C, C\#, Objective-C, Java, Python, IDL, VHDL, Fortran and PHP.[2] Doxygen is free software, released under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

Doxygen is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources, but it also supports other popular programming languages such as C, Objective-C, C\#, PHP, Java, Python, IDL (Corba, Microsoft, and UNO/OpenOffice flavors), Fortran, VHDL, Tcl, and to some extent.
Doxygen can help you in three ways:

\begin{itemize}
	\item It can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference manual (in ) from a set of documented source files. There is also support for generating output in RTF (MS-Word), PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man pages. The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code.
	\item You can configure doxygen to extract the code structure from undocumented source files. This is very useful to quickly find your way in large source distributions. Doxygen can also visualize the relations between the various elements by means of include dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams, and collaboration diagrams, which are all generated automatically.
	\item You can also use doxygen for creating normal documentation (as I did for the doxygen user manual and web-site).
\end{itemize}

Doxygen looks at the file’s extension to determine how to parse a file. If a file has an .idl or .odl extension it is treated as an IDL file. If it has a .java extension it is treated as a file written in Java. Files ending with .cs are treated as C\# files and the .py extension selects the Python parser. Finally, files with the extensions .php, .php4, .inc or .phtml are treated as PHP sources. Any other extension is parsed as if it is a C/C++ file, where files that end with .m are treated as Objective-C source files.

If you start using doxygen for an existing project (thus without any documentation that doxygen is aware of), you can still get an idea of what the structure is and how the documented result would look like. To do so, you must set the EXTRACT ALL tag in the configuration file to YES. Then, doxygen will pretend everything in your sources is documented. Please note that as a consequence warnings about undocumented members will not be generated as long as EXTRACT ALL is set to YES.

To analyse an existing piece of software it is useful to cross-reference a (documented) entity with its definition in the source files. Doxygen will generate such cross-references if you set the SOURCE BROWSER tag to YES. It can also include the sources directly into the documentation by setting INLINE SOURCES to YES (this can be handy for code reviews for instance).

Doxygen is developed under Mac OS X and Linux, but is set-up to be highly portable. As a result, it runs on most other Unix flavors as well. Furthermore, executables for Windows are available.

\subsubsection{Features of Doxygen}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Requires very little overhead from the writer of the documentation. 
	Plain text will do, Markdown is support, and for more fancy or structured 
	output HTML tags and/or some of doxygen's special commands can be used.
	\item Cross platform: Works on Windows and many Unix flavors (including 
	Linux and Mac OS X).
	\item Comes with a GUI frontend (Doxywizard) to ease editing the options 
	and run doxygen. The GUI is available on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.
	\item Automatically generates class and collaboration diagrams in HTML 
	(as clickable image maps) and $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ (as Encapsulated PostScript 
	images).
	\item Allows grouping of entities in modules and creating a hierarchy 
	of modules.
	\item Doxygen can generate a layout which you can use and edit to change 
	the layout of each page.
	\item Can cope with large projects easily.
\end{itemize}
